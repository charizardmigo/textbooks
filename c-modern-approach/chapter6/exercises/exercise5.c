Q: Which of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
   (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

   (a) while (i < 10) {...}
   (b) for (; i < 10;) {...}
   (c) do {...} while (i < 10);


A: (c) is not equivalent to (a) and (b), because the loop body is executed first before the condition is tested.
