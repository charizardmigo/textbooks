Q: Which of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
   (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

   (a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...
   (b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ...
   (c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) ...


A: (c) is not equivalent to (a) and (b), because i is incremented before the loop body is executed.
