Q: The following program fragments illustrate the logical operators.
   Show the output produced by each, assuming that i, j and k are int variables.

   (a) i = 10; j = 5;
       printf("%d", !i < j);

   (b) i = 2; j = 1;
       printf("%d", !!i + !j);

   (c) i = 5; j = 0; k = -5;
       printf("%d", i && j || k);

   (d) i = 1; j = 2; k = 3;
       printf("%d", i < j || k);


A: (a) 1
   (b) 1
   (c) 1
   (d) 1
