Q: Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments.
   Assume that i and j are int variables.

   (a) i = 6;
       j = i += i;
       printf("%d %d", i, j);

   (b) i = 5;
       j = (i -= 2) + 1;
       printf("%d %d", i, j);

   (c) i = 7;
       j = 6 + (i = 2.5);
       printf("%d %d", i, j);

   (d) i = 2; j = 8;
       j = (i = 6) + (j = 3);
       printf("%d %d", i, j);


A:
   (a) 12  12
   (b)  3   4
   (c)  2   8
   (d)  6   9
