Q: Assume that a program contains the following declarations:

   char c = '\1';
   short s = 2;
   int i = -3;
   long m = 5;
   float f = 6.5f;
   double d = 7.5;

   Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.

   (a) c * i    (c) f / c   (e) f - d
   (b) s + m    (d) d / s   (f) (int) f


A:
   (a) Value = -3, Type = int
   (b) Value = 7, Type = long
   (c) Value = 6.5f, Type = float
   (d) Value = 3.75, Type = double
   (e) Value = -1.0, Type = double
   (f) Value = 6, Type = int
