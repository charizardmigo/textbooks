Q: Which of the following are not legal constants in C? Classify each legal constant as either
   integer or floating-point.

   a) 010E2
   b) 32.1E+5
   c) 0790
   d) 100_00
   e) 3.978e-2


A:
   a), b) and e) are legal floating-point constants.

   c) and d) are illegal constants, because of undefined numeral 9
   in the octal number 0790, and the underscore in 100_000.
