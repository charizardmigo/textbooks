Q: Use typedefs to create types named Int8, Int16 and Int32. Define the types so that
   they represent 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit integers on your machine.


A:
    typedef char Int8;   // char uses 1 byte (8 bits) of memory
    typedef short Int16;   // short uses 2 bytes (16 bits) of memory
    typedef int Int32;   // int uses 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory
